# Model Providers

By default, Gpt4cli uses a mix of Anthropic models (via OpenRouter.ai) and OpenAI models, but you can use models from any provider that provides an OpenAI-compatible API, like [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/) (Anthropic, Gemini, and open source models), [Together.ai](https://together.ai) (open source models), [Replicate](https://replicate.com/), [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), and more.

## Limitations

While you can use Gpt4cli with many different providers and models as described above, some crucial Gpt4cli [roles](./roles.md) require reliable function calling, which can still be a challenge to find in open source models. Additionally, Gpt4cli's prompts have mainly been written and tested against Anthropic and OpenAI models.  

For these reasons, the default mix of Anthropic and OpenAI models will tend to provide the best experience, so it's recommended to start with the defaults.

In the future, we plan to offer prompts that are tailored for different models, and we also expect that other models and providers will catch up on the reliability front. Until then, **support for non-default models should generally be considered experimental.**

## Integrated Models

If you use [Gpt4cli Cloud](../hosting/cloud.md), you have the option of using **Integrated Models Mode** which allows you to use Gpt4cli credits to pay for AI models. No separate accounts or API keys are required in this case.

If, alternatively, you use **BYO API Key Mode** with Gpt4cli Cloud, or if you self-host Gpt4cli, you'll need to generate API keys for the providers you want to use.

## OpenRouter

### Account

If you don't have an OpenRouter account, first [sign up here.](https://openrouter.ai/signup)

### API Key

Once you've created an OpenRouter account, [generate an API key here.](https://openrouter.ai/keys)

## OpenAI

### Account

If you don't have an OpenAI account, first [sign up here.](https://platform.openai.com/signup)

### API Key

Once you've created an OpenAI account, [generate an API key here.](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

## Other Providers

Apart from those listed above,Gpt4cli can use models from any provider that is compatible with the OpenAI API, like Together.ai, Replicate, Ollama, and more. You'll need to create an account and generate an API key for any other providers you plan on using.

## Environment Variables

Now that you've generated API keys for your providers, export them as environment variables in your terminal.

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...

# optional - set api keys for any other providers you're using
export TOGETHER_API_KEY...
```

If you're using OpenAI as a model provider, you can also set a different base URL for API calls:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_BASE=... # optional - set a different base url for OpenAI calls e.g. https://<your-proxy>/v1
```

If you have multiple OpenAI orgs, you can specify which org to use:

```bash
export OPENAI_ORG_ID=... # optional - set the OpenAI OrgID if you have multiple orgs
```
