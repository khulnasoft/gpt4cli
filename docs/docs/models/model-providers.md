# Model Providers

By default, Gpt4cli uses a mix of Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google models. OpenAI models call the OpenAI API directly, while all other models are called via [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/).

You can also use Gpt4cli with models from any provider that provides an OpenAI-compatible API, like the aforementioned [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/), [Together.ai](https://together.ai), [Replicate](https://replicate.com/), [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), and more.

## Model Performance

While you can use Gpt4cli with many different providers and models as described above, Gpt4cli's prompts have mainly been written and tested against the built-in models and model packs, so you should expect them to give the best results.

## Built-in Models and Model Packs

Gpt4cli provides a curated set of built-in models and model packs.

You can see the list of available model packs with:

```bash
\model-packs # REPL
gpt4cli model-packs # CLI
```

You can see the list of available models with:

```bash
\models available # REPL
gpt4cli models available # CLI
```

## Integrated Models

If you use [Gpt4cli Cloud](../hosting/cloud.md), you have the option of using **Integrated Models Mode** which allows you to use Gpt4cli credits to pay for AI models. No separate accounts or API keys are required in this case.

If, alternatively, you use **BYO API Key Mode** with Gpt4cli Cloud, or if you self-host Gpt4cli, you'll need to generate API keys for the providers you want to use.

## OpenRouter

### Account

If you don't have an OpenRouter account, first [sign up here.](https://openrouter.ai/signup)

### API Key

Once you've created an OpenRouter account, [generate an API key here.](https://openrouter.ai/keys)

## OpenAI

### Account

If you don't have an OpenAI account, first [sign up here.](https://platform.openai.com/signup)

### API Key

Once you've created an OpenAI account, [generate an API key here.](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

## Other Providers

Apart from those listed above, Gpt4cli can use models from any provider that is compatible with the OpenAI API, like Together.ai, Replicate, Ollama, and more. You'll need to create an account and generate an API key for any other providers you plan on using.

## Environment Variables

Now that you've generated API keys for your providers, export them as environment variables in your terminal.

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...

# optional - set api keys for any other providers you're using
export TOGETHER_API_KEY...
```

If you're using OpenAI as a model provider, you can also set a different base URL for API calls:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_BASE=... # optional - set a different base url for OpenAI calls e.g. https://<your-proxy>/v1
```

If you have multiple OpenAI orgs, you can specify which org to use:

```bash
export OPENAI_ORG_ID=... # optional - set the OpenAI OrgID if you have multiple orgs
```
