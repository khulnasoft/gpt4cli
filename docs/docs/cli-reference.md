```

```bash
gpt4cli models default
```

### models available

Show available models.

```bash
gpt4cli models available # show all available models
gpt4cli models available --custom # show available custom models only
```

`--custom`: Show available custom models only.

### set-model

Update current plan models or model settings.

```bash
gpt4cli set-model # select from a list of models and settings
gpt4cli set-model planner openai/gpt-4 # set the model for a role
gpt4cli set-model gpt-4-turbo-latest # set the current plan's model pack by name (sets all model roles at onceâ€”see `model-packs` below)
gpt4cli set-model builder temperature 0.1 # set a model setting for a role
gpt4cli set-model max-tokens 4000 # set the planner model overall token limit to 4000
gpt4cli set-model max-convo-tokens 20000  # set how large the conversation can grow before Gpt4cli starts using summaries
```

With no arguments, Gpt4cli prompts you to select from a list of models and settings.

With arguments, can take one of the following forms:

- `gpt4cli set-model [role] [model]`: Set the model for a role.
- `gpt4cli set-model [model-pack]`: Set the current plan's model pack by name.
- `gpt4cli set-model [role] [setting] [value]`: Set a model setting for a role.
- `gpt4cli set-model [setting] [value]`: Set a model setting for the current plan.

Models are specified as `provider/model-name`, e.g. `openai/gpt-4`, `openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-3`, `together/mistralai/Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1`, etc.

See all the model roles [here](./models/roles.md).

Model role settings:

- `temperature`: Higher temperature means more randomness, which can produce more creativity but also more errors.
- `top-p`: Top-p sampling is a way to prevent the model from generating improbable text by only considering the most likely tokens.

Plan settings:

- `max-tokens`: The overall token limit for the planner model.
- `max-convo-tokens`: How large the conversation can grow before Gpt4cli starts using summaries.
- `reserved-output-tokens`: The number of tokens reserved for output from the model.

### set-model default

Update org-wide default model settings for new plans.

```bash
gpt4cli set-model default # select from a list of models and settings
gpt4cli set-model default planner openai/gpt-4 # set the model for a role
# etc. â€” same options as `set-model` above
```

Works exactly the same as `set-model` above, but sets the default model settings for all new plans instead of only the current plan.

gpt4cli models add
```

Gpt4cli will prompt you for all required information to add a custom model.
