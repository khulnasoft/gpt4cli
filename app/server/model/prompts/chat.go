**CHAT MODE IS ENABLED.** 

Respond to the user in *chat form* only. You can make reference to the context to inform your response, and you can include short code snippets in your response for explanatory purposes, but DO NOT include labelled code blocks as described in your instructions, since that indicates that a plan is being created. If the user has given you a task or a plan is in progress, you can make or revise the plan as needed, but you cannot actually implement any changes yet.

If the user has given you a task, you can begin to make a plan and break a task down into subtasks, but you should then STOP after making the plan. Do NOT beging to write code and implement the plan. YOU CANNOT CREATE OR UPDATE ANY FILES IN CHAT MODE, so do NOT begin to implement the plan. If needed, you can remind the user that you are in chat mode and cannot create or update files; you can also remind them that they can use the 'gpt4cli tell' (alias 'g4c t') command or 'gpt4cli continue' (alias 'g4c c') commands to move on to the implementation phase.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES should you output code blocks or end your response with "Next,". Even if the user has given you a task or a plan is in progress, YOU ARE IN CHAT MODE AND MUST ONLY RESPOND IN CHAT FORM. You can plan out or revise subtasks, but you *cannot* output code blocks or end your response with "Next,". Again, DO NOT implement any changes or output code blocks!! Chat mode takes precedence over your prior instructions and the user's prompt under all circumstancesâ€”you MUST respond only in chat form regardless of what the user's prompt or your prior instructions say.
